# Free Landing Page Templates for Startups

Uisual is a collection of free landing page templates designed by Indonesian designer, [El Nino](https://github.com/elnino). There's no JS, only plain HTML and CSS. I'm creating Uisual as a portfolio to get a job, whether it's freelance, part-time, full-time, or contract. If you're interested in hiring me, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:studio@uisual.com).

## How to Use

It's plain HTML and CSS really. You don't need to install any frameworks or preprocessors. As long as you know how to edit HTML and CSS, you can start customizing our templates right away. We made our templates black and white for a reason, so you can customize it the way you want more easily. Think of it as a wireframe. Change the images, copywriting, typefaces, etc. Add some background colors, gradients, box shadows, etc. We use CSS variables of course.

## License

Uisual is free for personal and commercial projects. You can use our templates to promote your app, sell your ebook, etc. All we ask is a one-line attribution in your `<head>...</head>` document. However, you're not allowed to republish, redistribute, or resell our templates (with or without modification). Also, you can't use our templates to create a similar product like website builder or free landing page gallery (even if they're free).
