Grid is free for personal and commercial projects. You can use Grid to promote your app, sell your ebook, etc. All we ask is a one-line attribution in your `<head>...</head>` document. However, you're not allowed to republish, redistribute, or resell Grid (with or without modification). Also, you can't use Grid to create a similar product like website builder or free landing page gallery (even if they're free).
